    This project aims to render a ball using Python code.
    By running ball.py the rendering results can be generated.
    The ball.ipynb generates 100 rendering results used to carry out evaluation by running Semicalibrated/demo_any.py
    The 100 images are saved in /src/
    SCPS files are cloned from https://github.com/yasumat/SemiCalibratedPS.git
